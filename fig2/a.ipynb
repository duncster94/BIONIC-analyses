The README provides instructions on installing and running the library. A config file is provided to replicate the performance evaluations from Fig. 2 a).\n",

I am happy to implement multiprocessing support to speed these up - if you are interested in this feature please open an [issue](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals/issues)."
