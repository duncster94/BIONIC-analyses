This repo contains Jupyter notebooks which implement the main figure analyses from the BIONIC manuscript.

You can run these notebooks by creating a new Python 3.6.10 environment and installing the required dependencies with

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have any questions about the analyses feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-analyses/issues).
